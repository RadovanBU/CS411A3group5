# Story 2 (Signing in and what happens when it fails):

#### As a user that has reached the landing page, I want to be able to sign into my Steam account so that I can access a summary of my profile.

On the login page, the user will enter their Steam login information as usual. If the user login is invalid or an error occurred, then it will redirect the user to another page which tells the user the login is invalid or “Sorry something went”. If the login is performed successfully, the user will be redirected to another page (Signned in User Story).
