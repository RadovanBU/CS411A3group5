# Story 1 (Functionality of landing page):

#### As a user, I want to be able to reach a landing site in order to gain access to the website. 

Our landing page will have a brief description of the website’s functionality. There will be a button that says “Sign in with Steam” which will link to a sign in page for Steam using a third party authentication service, such as OAuth. OAuth through Steam will be the only way to login in to access our service.
