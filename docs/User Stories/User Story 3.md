# Story 3 (Signed in user):

#### As a signed in user, I want to be able to see a list of subreddits based on my interactions on Steam.

If the Steam login is performed successfully the user will be redirected to another page where they will wait until we can generate the subreddits that they may be interested in. They will be presented as a drop down list where each subreddit will be presented in the following style:

    Name of Subreddit
    Description of the reddit, + amount of members and creation date

If we cannot find any related subreddit from the userâ€™s Steam account, then an apology will appear at the top of the page and a list of general gaming subreddit recommendations will be displayed below with the same style as above.
