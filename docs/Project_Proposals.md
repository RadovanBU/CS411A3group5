### Pitch 1:
An application that allows its users to input the URL of their Steam profile and receive a list of subreddits, Facebook groups/pages, and twitter accounts that they may be interested in. For examples, the Steam API would see that the user has logged a lot of hours in DOTA, so the application would return a descending list of links to the main DOTA subreddit, a DOTA discussion Facebook group, and a famous player's twitter account. The APIs used would be the Steam API, Reddit API, and Facebook and Twitter APIs if time permits. An extension to this project could be to recommend Twitch streamers based on the Steam profile.

### Pitch 2:
An application that allows its users to input a destination, a date range, and a selection of preferences. Based on those inputs, the application would return a tailored itinerary of things to do in that area based on online reviews, weather, and the user's preferences. Ideally, we would be able to pull tourist attractions, restaurants, and places to stay for the user. But for the scope of a semester project, it seems more feasible to focus on one of those aspects - tourist attractions. So, the APIs used for this would be a weather API and a tourism API.
