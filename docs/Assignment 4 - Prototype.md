# Assignment 4 - Prototype

We considered using Django or Flask as our web framework but chose against it since we felt that the MERN stack would make it easier to integrate a MongoDB database. Although an advantage of using Django or Flask is that Python executes synchronously therefore making the development process easier and more familiar for us. 

We chose to use the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js) for this project because the entire group was familiar with JavaScript and would be able to begin contributing immediately. Furthermore using React allows us to make our website more interactive for the user which will be necessary since we wish to change the website format depending on their Steam profile, React will allow us this flexibility.
